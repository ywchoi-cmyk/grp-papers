## Abstract

Clinical decision-support outputs can lack an au- ditable link between patient observations, encoded knowledge, conclusions, and recommendations. We present the CKG Clinical Explanation Engine, a downstream layer for a frozen, training-free clinical knowledge-graph reasoner that converts patient inference states and disease knowledge into typed facts, explicit rule-application traces, provenance-linked conclusions, and policy-licensed recommendations. The design separates measurement availability, representation completeness, and disease-specific activation; consequently, observed zero-activation evience is not treated as missing and partial representation is distinct from unobserved evidence. Optional language generation is restricted to symbolically licensed content. Across five usable workbooks (6,720 patients; 20,160 patient-disease traces; 1,021,440 feature-evidence rows), IG-range validity and knowledge provenance were 100%, numerical cross-sheet fidelity was 100% (120,960/120,960), and exported logical/report trace completeness was 100% (20,160/20,160). Availability representation consistency was 99.7028% (1,018,404/1,021,440); all 3,036 disagreements were confined to three systematic feature-cohort patterns. The corpus contained 86,783 observed zero-activation and 139,949 observed partially represented instances. A separate seeded 25-patient end-to-end audit completed without execution failure and passed all pre-specified trace, licensing, provenance, and state-consistency checks. These results establish structural and implementation auditability, not clinical correctness or utility.
