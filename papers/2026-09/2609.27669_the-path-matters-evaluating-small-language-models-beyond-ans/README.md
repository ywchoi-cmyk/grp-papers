## Abstract

Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly paired with knowledge graphs (KGs), yet end-to-end KG question answering conflates graph access, search, navigation, reasoning, and answer generation. This coupling makes it difficult both to determine whether an SLM can faithfully execute the reasoning path implied by a question and to attribute failures to navigation rather than to other stages of the pipeline. We isolate this capability by employing the THESEUS navigation and traceability framework and using frozen, off-the-shelf SLMs as local action policies. At each hop, the environment exposes the legal outgoing graph actions, and the model selects one executable graph action and decides whether to stop, without task-specific parameter updates, model-controlled beam search, or free-form answer generation. This controlled setting allows us to evaluate terminal-answer accuracy with Hits@1 together with path fidelity, using Path Edit Distance (PED) as the primary trajectory metric. Across the Kinship and MQuAKE-ST KGQAs, similarly sized local models differ substantially in answer accuracy and path fidelity, with the two metrics sometimes favoring different models. This model-dependent behavior also extends to prompting, as a single demonstrated trajectory can improve or degrade navigation depending on the model. These results motivate evaluating SLM graph reasoning beyond endpoint accuracy alone.
